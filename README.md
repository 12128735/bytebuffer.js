ByteBuffer.js - A Java-like ByteBuffer
======================================
This is a first, entirely untested release. It has not been used in any way, yet. However, it will become stable as
soon as it will be used for the cross-platform multiplayer component in [eSoccer](http://www.esoccer.me), a HTML5 game
developed at [University of Applied Sciences Bonn](http://www.h-brs.de).

Till then, don't use it! :-)
